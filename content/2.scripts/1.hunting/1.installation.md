## 1. Download Asset(s)

## 2. Install Dependencies

## 3. Insert SQL

## 4. Configure Items

## 5. Ensuring Asset(s)
To make sure the asset(s) starts & works properly we need to make sure all asset(s) start in the correct order in your server.cfg. Below you can find an example of how it can look like.

::tip
You can also create a folder called `[rx]` in your resource folder. If you own multiple scripts from RX, you will not need to add them all to your server.cfg seperately.
::

```bash [server.cfg]
# 1. Start framework
ensure es_extended or qb-core

# 2. Start ox_lib
ensure ox_lib

# 3. OPTIONAL: start ox_target or qb-target
ensure ox_target or qb-target

# 4. Start your inventory
ensure your_inventory

# 5. Start fmLib (MUST be ensured below frameworks, inventories & such)
ensure fmLib

# 6. Start props
ensure RxHuntingProps

# 7. Finally, start our asset singularly
ensure RxHunting
  # Or, start all of our assets at once
ensure [rx]
```

## 6. FAQ

::accordion
:::accordion-item{label="How can I disable the red border at the hunting locations?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
You can disable the red border by setting `debug` to `false` for each zone in `zones.lua. Below you will find an example.

```ts [zones.lua]
['Zone Box'] = {
    zone = {
        type = 'box',
        coords = vector3(-909.0355, 4788.1802, 200.0),
        size = vector3(150.0, 150.0, 600.0),
        rotation = 0,
        debug = false,
    },
    ...other code,
},
```

:::

:::accordion-item{label="Why do I not see any images in the hunting shops?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Make sure the `Config.ImgDirectory` in your `config.lua` is set correctly, and make sure it ends with a `/`. Below you will find an example.

```ts [config.lua]
Config.ImgDirectory = 'ox_inventory/web/images/' -- The directory where the images are stored.
```
